2024-12-30,The Criterion Challenge 2025,"cc2025, criterion challenge 2025, criterion, challenge, 2025",https://boxd.it/BLZqs,"Welcome to the fifth annual Criterion Challenge, hosted by <a href=""https://boxd.it/qhwB"">Ben</a> and featuring his <a href=""https://boxd.it/BazyQ"">original list</a>, where we celebrate The Criterion Collection!

Started: 1/1/25
Watched: 19/52
Completed: 36%

There are 52 categories. The goal is to watch any Criterion released film based on the categories below between 1/1/25-12/31/25. The films can be watched daily, weekly, or monthly, and in any order. Watch them at your own pace, but remember you have to finish by 12/31/25.

In my first participation here, I'll try to ensure that all the films are first-time watches, except for two or three, but this is subject to change if they are difficult to access.

Don't forget to visit <a href=""https://www.criterion.com/"">The Criterion Collection</a> for all your film needs!

Now, the most important…
