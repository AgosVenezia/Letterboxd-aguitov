2025-12-19,The Criterion Challenge 2026,"cc2026, criterion challenge 2026, criterion, challenge, 2026",https://boxd.it/QLG1e,"Welcome to the sixth annual Criterion Challenge, hosted by <a href=""https://boxd.it/qhwB"">Ben</a> and featuring his <a href=""https://boxd.it/QFicU"">original list</a>, where we celebrate The Criterion Collection!

Started: 1/1/26
Watched: 4/52
Completed: 7%
Finished: 
<a href=""https://boxd.it/D1dLe"">Ranking</a> 📊

There are 52 categories. The goal is to watch any Criterion released film based on the categories below between 1/1/26-12/31/26. The choices can be any films released by Criterion on 4K, Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, Laserdisc, or ones that have been featured on The Criterion Channel streaming service. The films can be watched daily, weekly, or monthly, and in any order. Watch them at your own pace, but remember you have to finish by 12/31/26.

In my second participation here, I'll try to ensure that all the films are first-time watches, except for two or three, but this is subject to change if they are difficult to access.

Don't forget to visit <a href=""https://www.criterion.com/"">The Criterion Collection</a> for all your film needs, and they have a pretty sweet <a href=""https://www.criterionchannel.com/browse"">streaming service</a> for endless options to choose from when you're struggling to find things to watch.

Now, the most important…
